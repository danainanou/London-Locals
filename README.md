# wdi-project-2 - London Locals



#Intro

Welcome to London Locals, my second WDI project in General Assembly. 

London Locals is a website aimed to support underepresented bands in the London area by providing them with an easy to use database. The idea sprung into my mind when I remembered talking with a friend about how difficult it is to get media attention on local artists.

London Locals is built on Node.JS and Express. It stores its information in a MongoDB and uses Mongoose to formulate models.

#Features

The homepage gives a brief description of the website when the main logo is hovered upon. 

The user then can navigate to the band directory and is then able to register and log in which provides them with the ability to add, edit and delete bands from the database. Bands can be favourited by the user and then displayed on their unique profile. 

A comment area is available both on the band page and on their profile. The profile can be edited and deleted and the comments provide an option to be deleted as well.

#Styling

Even though my attention of artists focuses on heavier sounds I wanted to not go down the path of another "edgy" heavy metal looking website which focuses on blacks, reds and almost unreadable fonts.

I believe the colour scheme is friendly enough to catch the attention of a wider audience who might become more curious to click and discover someting new. Darker shades of green and brown still offer a more edgy feeling but nothing that will scare a user awayby screaming "this is not your scene, you should not be here."

I used Bootstrap as my CSS framework mostly because of its grid system and the responsive design options but I did come to regret it since styling with Bootstrap can be somewhat limiting to what you can do.

For the homepage flip effect logo I used a jQuery library called, surprisingly, flip.

#Challenges

In all honesty I am still struggling heavily with JavaScript and even though I can understand code when I read it, I still feel very blocked when I attempt to write something on my own without somewhere to fall back to and reference my code to.

Most of the project was quite straightforward code-wise and it had a very step-by-step process feel to it. I mostly found challenging concepts that I did not come across before such as adding a favourite band to the user's profile and deleting comments.

Another challenge I faced was trying to set an opacity filter to the background image but I soon realised that it was a lot more difficult than what I anticipated.  

Having said this I overcame these challenges by asking for help when I believed I needed it because at the end of it I am here to learn how to incorporate my ideas and concepts into code.
